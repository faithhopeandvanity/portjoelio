My first-ever portfolio site!

Essentially, this is a basic webpage that I use to showcase my projects.

As I am a beginner, it's naturally quite scant at the moment, but it will be updated with my various web development projects.

This is my first-time creating interactivity beyond a basic static webpage; I wanted a functional nav bar at the top with links to the various sections of my website, and for the colours to be distinguishable and allow for greater accessibility.
